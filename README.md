2. Design. Describe the new system (in Step 5) you have developed for this task, the learning framework as well as the external resources you have deployed (e.g. corpora, dictionaries, programming toolkits, etc.)

I like your design.



Your design is sensible.

You make a number of improvements in order to fix shortcomings you have identified in the existing system.

It is very much driven by the knowledge of what is going wrong in misclassifications, which is good.



When you show the results, you need to show them side by side with original so we can see the improvement.



Your diagram is cut off by the end of the page.

3. Analysis. Critically evaluate and report the results from Steps 1-7, including the performance of your own system built in Step 5. Please try to answer all the questions set in the assessment, with your own critical discussion where possible try to investigate the advantages and limitations of each of the experimented approaches.

You have 9 pages of analysis



you really need to stick to the limit



It would be nice to present ALL your results side by side in a table, to see at a glance for example, the original rule based, the changed threshold, the new system.

e.g. I don't like the tiny text results on page 13.

The nbar charts are excellent showing the comparison of different systems and datasets.

You would also save space with one table rather than lots of text dumps.



Apart from that the analysis is generally extremely good. You show insight in giving reasons for different performances.



The error analysis is a bit disappointing. I would like to see you analyse more examples and draw out general themes of where one approach does better or worse than another.



It would be nice to have some quantitative element in error analysis, e.g. roughly what proportion of errors can be attributed to a particular cause, even if this were only done on a random subset of the data.

Very good.

There is good reflection on the difficulties and possible solutions â€“future directions you would take if you did a bigger project on this.
